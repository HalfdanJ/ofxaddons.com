What makes a good addon?

- the Readme:
=> lists dependencies w/gh urls
=> explains any installation gotchas
=> has example usage

- folder layout MUST be:
=> repo is named ofxMyAddon
=> src/ is required. Addon code goes here
=> optionally libs/ for non-OF code
=> example_* has example project(s)
=> each of those has (ideally) XCode, code-blocks (for win and linux)
=> examples should compile successfully from within OF/addons/ofxMyAddon/example_*

- start by downloading and modifying: http://github.com/obviousjim/ofxExampleAddon
=> run renaming script
